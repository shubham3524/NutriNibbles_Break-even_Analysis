## 🧮 Model Logic

The Excel model includes:
- **Raw Material Cost per Pack** (based on 150g unit and material proportions)
- **Monthly Revenue** = Units × ₹80  
- **Total Monthly Cost** = Variable Cost × Units + Fixed Costs  
- **Profit/Loss** = Revenue – Total Cost  
- **Break-Even Tracking** = Cumulative Profit ≥ 0

## 📈 Key Results & Insights

- ✅ **Break-even achieved in Month 7**  
- 📈 Profit margins exceeded **25% by Month 12**
- 💡 **Ghee and Nuts** drive ~70% of raw material cost — key pricing levers
